In today‚Äôs world, [Data Science](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/top-data-science-and-machine-learning-jobs-in-startups-vs-big-tech/) is growing rapidly. Bringing new advancements in data interpretation and analysis, and merging Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI) analytics with real-world applications, we can witness a new set of challenges and opportunities. 

We are in the world of innovations where 2024 is like a state fueled by algorithms, automated decisions and insights derived from potent data. Advanced usage of Generative AI and ethical responsibility for data are some of the major developments.

Data Scientists and businesses need to upgrade their skills and knowledge in order to maintain their pace with these latest advancements. Being in the field of data science, your commitment to lifelong learning is essential. [Great Learning Academy](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/academy)  is one such platform that provides you with relevant insights and skills to keep up with trends in this transformative field.  
In this blog, we will explore the latest trends as well as the skills you require to navigate the data science field. 

# What‚Äôs new in Data Science? Top trends of 2024:

## Edge Computing:

Wouldn‚Äôt it be amazing if you could get data insights instantly at its source? That‚Äôs what edge computing provides you. It is responsible for processing data near the source making it faster with low latency. This localised infrastructure reduces the bandwidth requirement and provides real-time analysis. As the market valuation of edge computing is increasing day by day, **Gartner** predicted that its usage by enterprises will rise to 75%, in 2025\.  
**Applications using Edge computing:** Sensors, Smart Speakers, Self-driving cars etc.

## [Generative AI](https://mygreatlearning.com/blog/generative-ai/): 

AI is no more about figures and graphs only, now it has the ability to create content, make designs, and predict decisions. It is shifting from single-domain proficiency to multimodal design, which is capable of interpreting diverse data types. Leading models of Generative AI, such as Wave2Vec for speech-to-text and CLIP for text-to-image, are already dominating the market.

## Augmented Analytics:

‚Äú*Data and AI are not here to replace humans but to augment and support them to make better decisions*‚Äù \- Cristian Felix, VP of product at Accern. 

A new advancement in the field of data science that enables you to easily prepare, visualise and get insights from your data. Augmented Analytics proves to be very useful for both data scientists as well as businesses due to increased efficiency, improved decision-making, a better understanding of customer behaviours and improved predictions.

## [AI-as-a-Service](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/artificial-intelligence-as-a-service/) platform:

The daunting task of hosting multiple servers is now solved\! AI-as-a-service (AIaaS) is an integrated solution for businesses encompassing various applications such as Natural Language Processing(NLP), machine learning models, predictive analysis and computer vision. 

## [Data Governance](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/ai-ml-can-transform-governance-for-good/) and Ethics:

It is estimated that by 2025, around 463 exabytes of data every day will be produced which was less than 3 exabytes a decade ago.  
Huge amounts of data produced every day should be protected in order to prevent data breaches.

As a data scientist, understanding ethical data practices, privacy laws, and data governance is not only necessary for your domain but also essential for building systems that people can trust.

# Essential Skills for Data Scientists in 2024

As a data scientist, you should rely on continuous learning commitment, with these trends, it is clear that skills needed for data science go far beyond algorithms and code. 

You can find various online [Data Science courses](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/data-science/courses) to upgrade your skills and also PGP and MS in Data Science Programs on popular platforms like Great Learning.

## Programming Languages:

The basic programming languages viz. Python, R, and SQL are still the backbone of data science.   
**Python:** With powerful, ready-made libraries such as [Pandas](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/python-pandas-tutorial/), [NumPy](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/python-numpy-tutorial/), and [Matplotlib](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/matplotlib-tutorial-for-data-visualisation/), Python is the central pillar of technical stacks. Its data manipulation and scraping techniques are widely accepted.   
You can start your Python learning journey with [Great Learning‚Äôs free Python course](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/academy/learn-for-free/courses/python-classes).   
[R](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/r-tutorial/), due to its diverse collection of packages for data science available in comprehensive R Archive Network(CRAN) is rapidly growing in demand. R programmers are one of the highest paid professionals in the data science industry.  
[SQL](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/sql-commands/), a fairly easy-to-learn language, is used in industry to manage and communicate with relational databases.

## Data visualisation:

Telling stories with data isn't interesting?  
Great Learning provides you with guided usage of tools like [Tableau](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/beginners-guide-to-tableau-desktop/), [PowerBI](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/power-bi-vs-tableau/), or Matplotlib which allows you to create visualisations. Graphical representation of data which helps in showing real-time trends and complex data in simpler formats is one of the most effective techniques.

## Machine Learning and AI:

The core of data science can become your advantage in 2024\. From Netflix recommendations to Instagram filters, [machine learning](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/difference-data-science-machine-learning-ai/) is integrated everywhere. The ever-increasing demand for machine learning can be fruitful for data scientists who are skilled with machine learning algorithms.

## Data wrangling:

Data scientists who are proficient in data wrangling which involves cleaning, transforming and organising raw data into usable format are highly demanded. Ensuring the quality and accuracy of data after its analysis using powerful Python libraries and tools mentioned above streamlines this process.

## Cloud Computing:

Handling data locally isn‚Äôt always feasible, cloud computing can be a better option when data from multiple regions need to be processed and analysed.  Knowing how to use AWS, [Google Cloud](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/new-to-learn-google-cloud-try-these-training-options/), or [Microsoft Azure](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/azure-portal/) will make you a step ahead of your competitors in this field.   
Want to learn [Cloud Computing from scratch](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/how-to-learn-cloud-computing-from-scratch/)? Great Learning provides you with the opportunity\!

## The right use of data: Data Governance and Ethics

Handling information that belongs to real people is a responsibility that data scientists bear. In order to protect people‚Äôs data, you should be aware of current data governance and ethics policies and work along with them to respect user privacy. Companies are increasingly looking for professionals who can handle data with confidentiality, integrity and availability.

# Conclusion

In this ever-evolving transformative field, adaptability is the key to success. Knowing tools and upskilling yourself allows you to stand firm in modern-day competition. Platforms like [Great Learning help data scientists](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/what-are-the-best-online-courses-for-aspiring-data-scientists/) and data enthusiasts to learn and grow continuously tailoring with the demands of the industry.
