## Perfection

***What is Perfection?*** Is it something which is easy to achieve or something far from a mere human's reach? Wanting to attain perfection is one of those adamant behaviours present in human nature. Aspiring to be the best, wanting to outshine others, to be superior, are the wants of a human to feed his competitive nature, his ego, But is perfection attainable? Is it possible for anyone or anything to be without flaws? If you ask me, I believe that nothing is perfect or can be perfect in this universe. When even the Gods could not achieve this much hyped goal, how can we? There are many instances in Indian Mythology, which tell us that even the Gods, residing high above the sky, have flaws. But we get anxious, distressed, when we are not the best, when other's work is better than ours. But I think that we should rather, instead of comparing ourselves to others, take pride in our flaws, both innate and nurtured, as they define our individuality. 

To me, perfection is attainable. It is like those stars, which guide us, motivate us, inspire us; but never move. We move so much in this pursuit, but they are far away from our reach. But does that mean that we should stop trying? Because the question arises as to why board the train which will only take you halfway. But this chain of thought is not incorrect, because according to me, it's the journey which matters. After all, life in itself is a trip, with its ups and downs, pros and cons. So, certainly we should try our best, give our best, but in this pursuit, we should not forget to enjoy this beautiful journey. In the end, it's the things we learn through our experiences and mistakes, which makes us a better person and takes us one step ahead towards the best, the perfection, the perfection of our thoughts, of our soul.
