Craft Beer is more than just a beverage, it can be better defined as a crafted work of art or a passion of a skilled brewer. At [Little Miami Brewing](https://www.littlemiamibrewing.com/), we believe that the craft beer brewing process translates a story at every step \- a story which begins with modest grains and ends with an aesthetically pleasing glass of liquid art. Explore our blog to find out how fascinating this journey is as we not only define the [craft beer brewing process](https://www.micetcraft.com/brewing-process/) but also the essential beer brewing equipment that brings creation to life.

## Craft Beer Brewing Process

## Step 1: Malting

Our journey from grains to glass is going to start from the transformation of grains. Barley, after ripening, is soaked in water, allowed to sprout, and then dried in a kiln. This process not only activates enzymes within the barley but also, impart flavors to our beer making it distinguishable.

## Step 2: Mashing

The sweetness locked from the above step is unlocked here. The malted Barley is milled into a coarse powder called **grist**. The grist is then mixed with hot water in a mash tun. The heat allows the starches of grist to convert into sugar, creating a thick, sweet liquid called **wort**. The wort provides the aroma to the beer.

## Step 3: Lautering

Also known as the Separation step. The wort is transferred into a lauter tun where liquid is separated from solid grain. To extract every bit of sugar, we spray hot water over the grain bed in a process called **sparging**. The result is a clear wort, pristine which is a sugar-rich wort for the next phase of the craft beer brewing process.

## Step 4: Boiling

Boiling delivers a critical step in this process. Here, we sterilize the wot, concentrate its flavor and prepare it for hops addition. **Hops** are fragrant green flowers which are added at various stages of the boil to provide bitterness and aroma to the beer. This step stands as a testament to the brewer‚Äôs creativity, as balancing the hop additions to achieve perfect flavor for each brew is not an easy task.

## Step 5: Fermentation

The real magic beans, yeast are added at this step but after rapid cooling of wort using a heat exchanger. In the fermentation vessel, yeast consumes sugar and produces alcohol and carbon dioxide as byproducts. The alchemical transformation which leads wort to become beer is crafted in this step.

## Step 6: Conditioning

To enhance beer‚Äôs final character, we let beer mature and meld together, allowing remaining yeast and sediment to settle out. Conditioning can take place in different vessels and at different temperatures depending on the desired results.

## Step 7: Packaging

We, at Little Miami Brewing, ensure the perfect packaging of beer after carbonation. Whether bottled, canned or kegged, the Craft Beer is ready for its debut\!
