## Ganga: The Choked Goddess

Patitoddhaarinni Jaahnavi Gangge Khannddita-Giri-Vara-Mannddita-Bhangge Bhiissma-Janani He Muni-Vara-KanyePatita-Nivaarinni Tri-Bhuvana-Dhanye

_O Jahnavi Ganga you liberate the degenerate, and you flow meandering through the Great Mountains of Himalayas, cutting through them and adorning them, the Mother of Bhisma and the daughter of the great Jahnu Muni, You save the fallen and bring prosperity to the three Worlds. Magic that no wand can capture flows through the blessed land of India in the form of the beloved, the reverend and the enchanting river Ganga._

Requisite to the culture and mythology of the country, it has, for longer than history, selflessly provided its all to everyone who seeks. She gives life as she engulfs the dead. She is a thread that unites all the land it travels and nourishes her environment. She bestows courteously her bounties and in return is choked, tormented, plagued and polluted. The carelessness of humans thus mortifies her who is ritually worshiped as goddess. She is abused as she is fed with human defecations, untreated industrial wastes, ceremonial wastes, polybags that are all venomous to her. She suffers from excruciating pains and she cries but is she heard?
It is true that the current state of the river is quite dreadful but for the dying soul of India there still is an ember of hope, for all her children haven't gone disavow. There have been many effective projects attempting to save Ganga from this calamity befalling her such as National Ganga River Basin Project, Clean India and Namami Gangey. These attempts, however, would remain mere attempts until and unless each and every citizen of the country realizes the gravity, wakes up, resolves and acts in for this crucial cause. So let us join hands and heed to her call for if Mother Ganga perishes she would take with her, us all.
